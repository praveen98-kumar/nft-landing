                        A metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection. In futurism and science fiction, it is often described as a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual and augmented reality headsets.

                    <Accordian title={"WHY DO WE NEED ROYALTIES?"}>
                        The amount of royalties was fixed at 5% to finance the Weirdos Club's projects. We have the ambition to organize multiple events around the world in order to strengthen the community and build a network of entrepreneurs and investors with the same mindset and common interests.
